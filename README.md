SDN Technology 

 المشاكل  التي تواجههم من قبل | problem before 
 1- mangment Headache 
 we need to connect  to each Switch in the DC lonely to manage it.
 
 
 2- MGMT Protocols :
we was able to manage the switches with Commanfs only using the console or the telnet brack screeen.

Software Defined Network 


1- All the coming new switches that is working with SDN are managed by another device called ( Centralized Controller )
2- the SDN Controller is considered as a centralized managent point for all devices in my network (switches, Routers, Firewalls, … etc)

cloud computing provides  us a mean by which  we can Access  the application as utility over the internet it allow us to create , configuration and custom  applications  online , with cloud computing  users access Database resources via the internet  from anywhere  for as long they need without worrying about any maintenance or management of actual resources . 
ماهي السحابة | what is cloin term of cloud refer to a Network or Internet, in other words we can say the cloud is something  which present at Remoteocations. 
cloud can provide  services over network on public networks or provides network (WAN - LAN - VPN ). 
Application  auch as : email , web conferencing , CRM  all run in cloud

ماهي الحوسبة السحابة | what is cloud computing 


cloud computing  is both a combination of software and hardware based on computing resources Delivered  as a network services. 

 مفاهيم أساسية | Basics Concept 
 

 there are certain services and models working behind the scene making the clud computing  feasible and accessible to end users. 

 

Flowing are working models for cloud computing : 
Deployment models 
Services Models 

Deployment Models 
Deployment Models ,define the type of access to Cloud , and how cloud located ? cloud can have any of the four types of access : public , private , hybrid and Community 

- public cloud : allows system and services to be easliy accessible  to the general  Public , Public cloud may be less secure. 
- private cloud : allows system and services to be accessible  within an organisation , It offers increase security. 
- hybrid cloud : allows system and services to be accessible  by group of organisations .
- Community cloud : mixture of public and private  cloud , the critical activities  are performed  using private  using private  cloud while non- critical activities  are performed using public cloud .

Service Model 


Service Model  are reference models on which the cloud computing  is based. these can be categorises  into three basics as : 

- infrastructure  as a services  (IaaS)
- Platform as a services ( PasS) 
- Software  as a services (SaaS)

ماهو  infrastructure  as a services  



IssS : is the Delivery of technology  infrastructure as an on demand scalable services.  
also provides access to fundamentals  resources  such as physical  machine , virtual machine  , virtual storage  …. 


- billed based on usage 
- multi tenant virtualisation  environment 
- can be coupled with managed services OS and Application  support 


ماهو Platform as a services 
provides the runtime environment  for application  Development  and deployment tools. 
also provide all of the facilities required to support the complete lifecycle of building and delivering web applications and services entirely from internet . and application must be developed  with particular platform in mind 

- Muliti tenant environment 
- highly  scalable multi tier architecture 

    ماهو Software  as a service 
    
    Saas model allows th use Software  application  as a service to end user 
    SaaS is software delivery  methodology  that provides  licensed multi -tanant access to software and its functions remotely  as Web-based services 
    - usually billed based on usage 
    - usually  multi tenant environment  
    - highly scalabile architecture
